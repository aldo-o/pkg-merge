# pkg-merge
A tool to merge parts of a PS4 PKG into one entire PKG file. Useful for installing a full game on your system. Written in C++.

# Usage
## User-friendly
1. Download the latest release for MacOS or Windows from the [Release Page](https://github.com/aldoblack/pkg-merge/releases)
2. Extract pkg-merge.exe
3. Go to where you extracted pkg-merge.exe, and locate/create a folder with all your PKG pieces inside.
4. Drag the folder of PKG files on top of the pkg-merge.exe program. The merging process should begin.

## Issues
1. For some reason, on Windows the process is slower. It might have to do with path. Also, I am testing it on Parallels.
